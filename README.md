# Network Programming Assignments

This repository contains implementations of 5 network programming assignments focused on socket programming and client-server communication.

## Assignments

### Assignment 1: Basic Client-Server Communication
Implementation of a fundamental TCP socket-based client-server application that establishes connection and exchanges messages between endpoints.

### Assignment 2: Concurrent Server Implementation
Development of a server capable of handling multiple client connections simultaneously using threading or process-based concurrency techniques.

### Assignment 3: UDP-based Communication System
Implementation of connectionless communication using UDP sockets, demonstrating datagram-based message exchange between client and server.

### Assignment 4: Network File Operations
Creation of a file transfer system that allows clients to upload, download, and perform operations on files stored on a remote server.

### Assignment 5: Advanced Socket Programming
Implementation of a more complex networked application that combines multiple protocols and demonstrates practical network programming concepts.

## Running the Code

Each assignment directory contains client and server components that can be executed independently. Use the following general pattern to run:

```bash
# For server
python server.py

# For client
python client.py
